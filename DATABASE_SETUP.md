# Project Setup and Database Configuration

## Current Status

✅ **Authentication System**: Fully implemented with Supabase
✅ **Route Protection**: Middleware protecting all routes
✅ **Logout Functionality**: Already implemented in UserMenu component
✅ **Project Saving Code**: Logic exists in compare page
✅ **Projects API**: Endpoint created to fetch user projects
✅ **Enhanced UI**: Projects page with loading states and project management

## Issues to Resolve

### 1. Database Table Setup
The `projects` table may not exist or may not have the correct Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Solution**: Run the SQL script in Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- Location: /projects_table.sql
```

### 2. Testing Database Connection
Use the test endpoint to verify database setup:
```
GET /api/test-db
```

### 3. Debugging Project Saving
The compare page now includes console logging. Check browser console when saving projects.

## Database Schema

The `projects` table should have:
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` (TEXT NOT NULL)
- `project_data` (JSONB)
- `user_id` (UUID NOT NULL, references auth.users)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

## RLS Policies Required

1. `Users can view own projects` - SELECT policy
2. `Users can insert own projects` - INSERT policy  
3. `Users can update own projects` - UPDATE policy
4. `Users can delete own projects` - DELETE policy

## How to Test

1. **Logout**: Click on user avatar → "Log out" (already working)
2. **Save Project**: 
   - Go to `/compare`
   - Configure materials
   - Click "Save Project"
   - Check browser console for debugging info
3. **View Projects**:
   - Go to `/projects` 
   - Should show saved projects
   - Use `/api/test-db` to verify database connection

## Features Implemented

### Authentication
- Login/Signup forms with enhanced styling
- Session management with AuthProvider
- Protected routes with middleware
- User menu with profile info and logout

### Project Management
- Save projects from compare page
- View projects list with metadata
- Delete projects functionality
- Responsive UI with loading states

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/projects` - Fetch user projects
- `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` - Delete specific project
- `GET /api/test-db` - Test database connection and permissions

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard to create the table
2. Test the `/api/test-db` endpoint to verify setup
3. Try saving a project from the compare page
4. Check the projects page to see if saved projects appear

## Debugging

Console logs are added to:
- Project saving process (compare page)
- Projects API fetching
- Database test endpoint

Check browser console and server logs for detailed error information.
